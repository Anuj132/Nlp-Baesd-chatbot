What is NLP? How does it work? How is it used? What are the workings and advantages of a natural language processing chatbot and do you actually need one? We break down this AI sub-domain with focus on its application in chatbot technologies in plain terms, to make the concept comprehensible and accessible to anyone - including non-techies.‍

Chatbots, though they have been on the scene for quite a few years, are still a hot topic. Generally speaking, you get two types of approaches to their creation:

Companies determined to develop bots capable of natural conversations indistinguishable from human ones using NLP and machine learning.
Companies focused on functional bots good at accomplishing specific tasks and do so quickly and efficiently, making the bots’ perceived humanity a secondary matter.
The issue is that with all the hype around artificial intelligence, it’s often difficult to maintain perspective; distinguish fact from fiction; manage user expectations, or simply resist being seduced by technology for its own sake (rather than keeping your business/marketing goal in mind).

In fact, while any talk of chatbots is usually accompanied by the mention of AI, machine learning and natural language processing (NLP), many highly efficient bots are pretty “dumb” and far from appearing human.

Rule-based bots with option buttons, yes-no questions, keyword recognition, and quick answer suggestions seem to generate great results. Sometimes even better than NLP!

Nevertheless, this doesn’t mean you should give up on it. Natural Language Processing does have an important role in the matrix of bot development. The key is a successful application of NLP is understanding how and when to use it.

To make the sense of it all, we broke down the essence NLP, its inner workings and possible uses.

# Why Machines Need NLP?
Everything we express in written or verbal form encompasses a huge amount of information that goes way beyond the meaning of individual words.

The combination of topic, tone, selection of words, sentence structure, punctuation/expressions allows humans to interpret that information, its value, and intent.

Theoretically, humans are programmed to understand and often even predict other people’s behavior using that complex set of information.

# What is NLP?
Natural language is the language humans use to communicate with one another. On the other hand, programming language was developed so humans can tell machines what to do in a way machines can understand.

For example, English is a natural language while Java is a programming one.

Natural Language Processing facilitates human-to-machine communication without humans needing to “speak” Java or any other programming language as it allows machines to obtain and process information from written or verbal user inputs.

# NLP is not Just About Creating Intelligent Chatbots...
NLP is a tool for computers to analyze, comprehend, and derive meaning from natural language in an intelligent and useful way. This goes way beyond the most recently developed chatbots and smart virtual assistants. In fact, natural language processing algorithms are everywhere from search, online translation, spam filters and spell checking.

So, by using NLP, developers can organize and structure the mass of unstructured data to perform tasks such as intelligent:

Automatic summarization (intelligently shortening long pieces of text)
Automatic suggestions (used to speed up writing of emails, messages, and other texts)
Translation (translating phrases and ideas instead of word for word)
Named entity recognition (used to locate and classify named entities in unstructured natural languages into pre-defined categories such as the organizations; person names; locations; codes; quantities; price; time; percentages)
Relationship extraction (extraction of semantic relationships among the identified entities in natural language text/speech such as “is located in”, “is married to”, “is employed by”, “lives in”, etc.)
Sentiment analysis (helps identify, for instance, positive, negative and neutral opinion form text or speech widely used to gain insights from social media comments, forums or survey responses)
Speech recognition (enables computers to recognize and transform spoken language into text - dictation - and, if programmed, act upon that recognition - e.g. in case of assistants like Google Assistant Cortana or Apple’s Siri)
Topic segmentation (automatically divides written texts, speech or recordings into shorter, topically coherent segments and is used in improving information retrieval or speech recognition)

# How Does Natural Language Processing Work?
One of the best things about NLP is that it’s probably the easiest part of AI to explain to non-technical people.

Take one of the most common natural language processing application examples, the prediction algorithm in your email. The software is not just guessing what you will want to say next but analyzes the likelihood of it based on tone and topic. Engineers are able to do this by giving the computer and “NLP training”.

‍In other words, they provide the software with a huge amount of data about language including sentences and phrases as well as transcripts from live conversations/emails. This way, over time, computer programs are able to learn how to pair words together; what it is we are trying to convey, and what we need to achieve with that communication.

Naturally, predicting what you will type in a business email is significantly simpler than understanding and responding to a conversation.

Still, the decoding/understanding of the text is, in both cases, largely based on the same principle of classification.

Generally, the “understanding” of the natural language (NLU) happens through the analysis of the text or speech input using a hierarchy of classification models.

# Three Pillars of an NLP Based Chatbot
Now it's time to take a closer look at all the core elements that make NLP chatbot happen.

# 1) Dialog System
To communication, people use mouths to speak, ears to hear, fingers to type, and eyes to read.Chatbot, too, needs to have an interface compatible with the ways humans receive and share information with communication. That is what we call a dialog system, or else, a conversational agent.

There are no set dialog system components.

But for a dialog system to indeed be a dialog system, it has to be capable of producing output and accept input. Other than that they can acquire a variety of forms. You can differentiate them based on:

Modality (text-based, speech-based, graphical or mixed)
Device
Style (command-based, menu-driven and - of course - natural language)
Initiative (system, user, or mixed)
# 2) Natural Language Understanding
So, you already know NLU is an essential sub-domain of NLP and have a general idea of how it works.

Still, it’s important to point out that the ability to parse what the user is saying is probably the most obvious weakness in NLP based chatbots today. Human languages are just way too complex. Besides enormous vocabularies, they are filled with multiple meanings many of which are completely unrelated.

To nail the NLU is more important than making the bot sound 110% human with impeccable NLG.

Why?

If a bot understands the users and fulfills their intent, most won’t care if that response is a bit taciturn… It doesn't work the other way around. A bot that can’t derive meaning from the natural input efficiently can have the smoothest small talk skills and nobody will care. Not even a little!

# 3) Natural Language Generation
Given that the NLP chatbot successfully parsed and understood the user’s input, its programing will determine an appropriate response and “translate” it back to natural language.Needless to say, that response doesn’t appear out of thin air.

For the NLP to produce a human-friendly narrative, the format of the content must be outlined be it through rules-based workflows, templates, or intent-driven approaches. In other words, the bot must have something to work with in order to create that output.

‍Currently, every NLG system relies on narrative design - also called conversation design - to produce that output. This narrative design is guided by rules known as “conditional logic”.

These rules trigger different outputs based on which conditions are being met and which are not.
